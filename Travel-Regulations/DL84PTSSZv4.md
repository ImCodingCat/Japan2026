**Audio/Speech Summary (Narration):**
The speaker warns viewers about a trivial matter in Japan that could lead to a fine of up to 20 million rupiah. The issue concerns moving into and later leaving an apartment (apato).

The speaker advises that when moving into a new apartment, you must first video record the condition of the unit. Specifically, check and record the floor for any holes or scratches. Also, check the functionality of appliances, such as the buttons on the toilet.

The reason for this recording is that when the contract ends and you move out, the apartment must be returned in normal or good condition.

The speaker concludes by asking the viewers to follow for more information.

**Overall Message:**
The video warns people about potential hefty fines (up to 20 million IDR) in Japan when renting an apartment. The core message stresses the importance of thoroughly documenting (via video) the initial condition of the apartment, including floors and appliances, upon moving in. This documentation is crucial to prevent being unfairly held responsible for pre-existing damage when the rental contract ends, thus avoiding damage fees or fines.
