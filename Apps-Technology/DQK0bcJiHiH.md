# Hey all! DON'T SCREAM TOGETHER is an online co-op jumpscare horror simulator where you and friends walk through a pitch-black forest with camcorders in 1993. Use proximity chat and escape the forest. But if anyone screams or speaks too loudly, the game restarts or the screamer returns as the hunter!

It's super fun with friends! Thanks for your support.

The uploaded video seems to be a trailer or announcement for a cooperative survival-horror game.

Here is the analysis of the communicative content:

**1. Text Content:**
*   **Overlay throughout the video:** "our new game announcement! 'DON'T SCREAM TOGETHER'"
*   **Gameplay rules stated:** "- 4 player co-op - If you scream, the game restarts"
*   **Alternate rule stated (accompanying a jump scare):** "- Or if you scream, you can come back to Hunt your friends!"
*   **Call to action (throughout):** "(Wishlist on Steam)"
*   **End screen text on failure:** "YOU SCREAMED PRESS ANY KEY TO RESTART"
*   **Final Call to action:** "DON'T SCREAM TOGETHER WISHILIST NOW ON STEAM"
*   **In-game text:** `1993` (timestamp), `uxo.mov file saved...` (appears several times)

**2. Audio/Speech:**
The audio consists of players communicating nervously during gameplay:
*   Commentary on external sounds: "Did you guys hear that siren?"
*   Expressed paranoia/fear: "I keep thinking I'm hearing things," "I think it's just me," "I swear I heard something breathe."
*   Shouting warnings/commands while running: "Oh, oh, oh, don't look back, run, run, run."
*   A loud scream/jump scare leading to the game failure.

**3. Main Message:**
The video is an announcement and feature demonstration for a new 4-player cooperative horror game called "DON'T SCREAM TOGETHER." The core mechanic is a twist on the horror genre: players must maintain silence, as screaming or making noise causes the game to restart or, if the alternate rule is active, allows the screamer to return to hunt the remaining friends. The video uses gameplay footage to illustrate the tense, sound-sensitive atmosphere and features a jump scare that triggers the "failure" state (YOU SCREAMED). The overall message is to encourage viewers to wishlist the newly announced game on Steam.
