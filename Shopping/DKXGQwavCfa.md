**2. Audio/Speech:**

The speaker provides tips for first-time visitors to Japan, summarizing the points written on the screen:

*   When in Tokyo or Kyoto, queue on the left side of the escalator, but in Osaka, queue on the right (the left side is for passing/hurrying).
*   When paying cash at a convenience store (Konbini), put the money on the provided tray instead of handing it directly to the cashier.
*   Toilet tissue should generally be flushed down the toilet bowl, not put in a trash can.
*   Because public trash cans are rare, travelers should carry a plastic bag for their trash outside the hotel.
*   For dining, line up outside the restaurant. Adults should order a minimum of one menu item each (sharing is often disallowed for adults, but acceptable for children).
*   Always queue for public transportation.
*   Travelers will accumulate a lot of coins (even small ones are valuable), so it's best to bring a coin purse.
*   Locals are sensitive to strong odors, so avoid using overly pungent perfumes.
*   The Japanese are generally quiet in public, even in crowded areas, so tourists should avoid shouting or being overly loud.
