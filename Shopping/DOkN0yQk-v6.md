I always come to Daiso for budget shopping and souvenir hauls but this store really exceeds my expectation! 

As a frequent traveller of Japan, one of my weakensses are these 100Â¥ shops! . 

This store really has the most curated and beautiful ceramic kitchen wares I ever seen especially those Japan-curated mugs! 

They also do sell alot of home-essentials and souvenirs that will definitely worth for the price! 

Honestly, my mind wentÂ  paralyzed everytime I visit shops like this!
