# hoki-hokian sih kalo thrifting..

btw, thrifting tuh barang bekas / bukan baru ya~

lokasi:
1. puffer putih, puffer merah cabe : BOOKOFF SUPER BAZAAR è¥¿åå¤§æ£®åº / BOOK OFF Omori

2. rok putih : BOOK OFF PLUS NAMBA

3. coat, puffer oren : Tokyo Flea Market, ini ada di maps & deket sama BOOK OFF Omori, jadi sekalian aja.. 

ps. kalo ke Tokyo Flea Market tuh WAJIB KELILING ya, karna depan-depan tuh masih mahal, agak dalem / jauh dari pintu masuk baru lebih murce & disini ga jual barang bekas doang sih, banyak barang baru, DIY juga, cuman ya gitu.. kayak pasar kaget.. (kalo yang nyari branded stuff aku ga saranin sih, takut gak ori..)ð

kalo mau opsi lain selain BOOK OFF / Tokyo Flea Market, ada yang namanya 2nd Street, cari aja.. banyak juga kok cabangnya! 
(coat coklat yang ku pake di clip pertama itu aku thrift tahun lalu di 2nd Street Shinsaibashi *kalo gak salah* dan harganya cuman Â¥800 atau setara 80-90rb!) 

BOOK OFF / 2nd Street banyak cabang ya, tapi jangan lupa baca review dulu sebelum datengin..

dah itu aja ges~

**2. Audio/Speech Summary:**

The speaker is sharing her experience shopping for second-hand clothing (thrifting) in Japan, specifically focusing on outerwear.

- She states that it would be regrettable to visit Japan without thrifting.
- She shows a white puffer jacket she bought for ¥880 (approx. 90,000 Indonesian Rupiah), praising its quality, wind resistance, and lack of typical used clothing stains.
- She tries on a long brown coat (duffle coat style) and sees another coat marked at ¥800 (also roughly 80,000 Indonesian Rupiah), but she decided against both because they were too heavy.
- She mentions acquiring a red puffer jacket for ¥1300 but admits she felt unconfident wearing the color, suggesting it was a wasted purchase.
- She displays a white lacey skirt purchased for ¥550 (approx. 50,000 Indonesian Rupiah).
- She highlights that all these successful finds (puffer and skirt) were bought at a store called Book Off.
- She then shifts to a Tokyo flea market, noting it was messy, like a "surprise market," and not as organized as Book Off. She mentions that the neatly arranged items at the market were expensive.
- Her mother successfully bought a coat at the market for only ¥500, which looked brand new.
- The speaker then shows another orange puffer she bought for ¥500, joking that it looks like something from a low-quality online market (Shopee Ciaode).
- She concludes by telling viewers to check the caption for detailed location information.

**3. Main Message:**

The video is a testimonial/guide on **thrifting for winter clothes in Japan**, specifically focusing on the affordability and quality of second-hand coats and jackets found at stores like Book Off and various flea markets. The core message is that great, inexpensive winter wear can be found in Japan, provided the shopper looks in the right places (like Book Off) and accepts the occasional risky, less-than-perfect find (like the red jacket).
