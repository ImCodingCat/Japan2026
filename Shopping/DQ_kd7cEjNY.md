3 swaps to save money on your Japan trip

Don't go to Uniqlo for cheap clothes...
...instead go to these more affordable stores
GU - Uniqlo's cheaper sister brand
Shimamura - family-friendly prices, big sizes too
Workman - for workwear that doesn't break the bank

Instead of buying drinks at vending machines...
or convenience stores
...go to the pharmacy instead
Drinks are 50% cheaper in the pharmacy fridges
Super easy to do as pharmacies are everywhere in Japan
Literally just 80 yen (50 cents) per bottle....

Don't pay at any of these stores without..
General Shopping
Don Quijote
DAIMARU
Electronics
BIC Camera
EDION
Cosmetics
Sundry
Cosmos
Glasses
JINS
