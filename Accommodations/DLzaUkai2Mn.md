**2. Audio/Speech Summary:**

The speaker explains that in most Japanese hotels, check-in is after 3 PM. He is standing outside a hotel at 10 AM, which is too early, but he wants to drop off his luggage first. He then asks the audience what phrase he should use in Japanese for this situation, introducing the target phrase.

He then enters the hotel lobby, greets the staff ("どうも"), and uses the full phrase: "Today I am Tomoyoshi, staying for two nights, but may I leave my luggage first?" (or similar translation).

After successfully dropping off the luggage, he shows the luggage tag and concludes that the phrase worked.

**3. Main Message:**

The video teaches a practical and polite Japanese phrase travelers can use at a hotel to ask if they can leave their luggage before the official check-in time:

**"今日から [number] 泊する [Name] ですが、先に荷物を預けてもいいですか。 (Kyō kara [number]-haku suru [Name] desu ga, saki ni nimotsu o azukete mo ii desu ka?)"**

The overall takeaway is that while checking in early is usually impossible, most Japanese hotels allow guests to leave their bags beforehand, and the video provides the exact Japanese vocabulary and structure needed for this request.
