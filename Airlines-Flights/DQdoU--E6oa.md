### 2. Audio/Speech Summary

The speaker warns listeners about using Batik Air or the Lion Group airlines, especially outside of Indonesia (specifically Thailand). He recounts an experience where he bought a ticket (bought by a friend) that did not include a baggage allowance. Upon checking in, he was surprised to learn this. He was charged an exorbitant excess baggage fee, stating that the price was 690 Thai Baht per kilogram (about 350,000 Indonesian Rupiah per kg). Because he had 30 kg of baggage (10 kg for himself and two friends), he was forced to pay 10.5 million Indonesian Rupiah (about $650 USD) for the baggage fee for a one-way trip, which was more expensive than the actual passenger ticket. He emphasizes that if he had pre-booked the baggage online, it would have only cost a few hundred thousand rupiah. He contrasts this with his experience flying Malaysia Airlines, which automatically included a 20 kg baggage allowance with no drama. Finally, he mentions previous negative experiences with the airline, including delays and three gate changes in one flight, and concludes by advising viewers not to repeat his mistake of neglecting to check the baggage policy when booking Lion Group tickets abroad.

### 3. Main Message

The video's core message is a strong warning and travel tip regarding flying with Lion Group airlines (specifically Batik Air or Thai Lion Air, as the incident occurred in Thailand). The speaker advises travelers to diligently check and preemptively purchase baggage allowances when booking low-cost carriers, as neglecting this detail can lead to extremely high, penalty-like excess baggage charges at the counter, costing millions, and potentially exceeding the price of the flight ticket itself.
