Here is an analysis of the video's communicative content:

**1. Text Content:**

*   **Slide 1:** "MULAI", "KALAU POWERBANK LO", "INI", "SIAP-SIAP AJA DISITA", "DI BANDARA CHINA" (Starting now, if your power bank doesn't have this [logo/sign], get ready for it to be confiscated at China airports.)
*   **Slide 2:** "BERLAKU DI BANDARA", "DOMESTIK", "POWERBANK KW", "JUGA BERESIKO KENA SITA" (Applies to International and Domestic airports. Counterfeit power banks also risk confiscation.)
*   **Slide 3:** "KURANG", "DARI 20.000 mAH", "ATAU 100 WA" (Less than 20,000 mAh or 100 Wh.)
*   **Slide 4:** "WAJIB", "DIPAKAI SELAMA PENERBANGAN", "CEK LAGI SEBELUM" (Must be [carried on hand] and used during the flight. Check again before leaving.)

**(Note: There is a visual overlay of three power bank icons with checkmarks/crosses. One with "CCC" (China Compulsory Certification) is checked, while "UL" and "CE" are crossed, suggesting only CCC-certified power banks are safely allowed.)**

**2. Audio/Speech:**

The speech reinforces the text content, acting as a narration:

*   It warns that if a power bank lacks a specific required logo/certification (presumably CCC, based on the visual), it risks confiscation at Chinese airports.
*   This rule applies to both international and domestic flights in China.
*   Counterfeit or unbranded power banks also face risk of confiscation.
*   The capacity limit for power banks is stressed: they must be less than 20,000 mAh or 100 Wh.
*   The power bank must be carried as carry-on luggage (hand carry) and cannot be used during the flight.
*   It finishes with a reminder to check these regulations before traveling.

**3. Main Message:**

The video is a warning and informational guide regarding the strict regulations and confiscation policies for power banks at Chinese airports (both international and domestic). The core requirements are:
1. The power bank must have the appropriate Chinese certification (CCC logo).
2. Counterfeit or unbranded power banks are prohibited.
3. The capacity must be less than 20,000 mAh or 100 Wh.
4. The power bank must be carried as hand luggage and cannot be used while airborne.
