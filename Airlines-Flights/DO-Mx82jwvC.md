# Masih banyak di Bandara Kualanamu ku lihat yang kesulitan ngisi All Indonesia atau MDAC  kalau di Malaysia. Mungkin masih banyak yang belum paham atau baru pertama kali.

Saran ku isi saat menunggu boarding sebelum naik pesawat, biar gak terburu-buru dan gak salah isi. Jadi pas nyampe di Imigrasi negara tujuan tinggal tunjukin aja, gak perlu isi lagi. Semoga infonya bermanfaat. ðð»

**Audio/Speech Summary**
The speaker mentions that the Kuala Namu (Medan) airport now has auto gates, but he couldn't use them because he was traveling with a baby, noting that in Singapore there are special queues for those with babies. He then shares a negative experience in Medina where his child, who was asleep, was forced to wake up for immigration checks, which was a long and difficult process.

The main point of his advice is that passengers should fill out the "All Indonesia" online form (or the equivalent MDAC for Malaysia) before getting on the plane to avoid problems and delays upon arrival. He points out that many people neglect to do this and end up filling it out at the immigration hall, leading to confusion and potential errors. Filling it out beforehand saves time and hassle.

**Main Message**
The video is a travel tip and warning reminding international travelers arriving in Indonesia (or planning to travel internationally) to complete the digital immigration forms (specifically referring to *allindonesia.imigrasi.go.id* for Indonesia, similar to MDAC in Malaysia) *before* boarding their flight to streamline the process, avoid being delayed or scolded by immigration officers, and prevent accidental errors when rushing to fill out the form upon arrival.
