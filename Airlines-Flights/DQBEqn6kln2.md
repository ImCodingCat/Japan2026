# Japan Airlines (JAL) is offering free domestic flights for international tourists as part of a new program aimed at encouraging travel to lesser-known destinations across Japan. The offer applies when you book an international JAL flight into Japan and include a domestic leg within the same reservation. 

This means that once youâve arrived in Japan, you can fly to another city â such as Sapporo, Fukuoka, or Okinawa â without paying extra for the domestic fare, though you still need to cover taxes and airport fees.

The initiative is part of Japanâs strategy to reduce overtourism in hotspots like Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka while promoting regional areas that often get overlooked. 

Over 60 domestic destinations are included in the program. However, there are conditions: you must book both flights together, availability is limited, and certain travelers (for example, from the U.S., Canada, and China) may face a small stopover fee if they stay more than 24 hours in their arrival city.

Overall, itâs a smart way to make your Japan trip more diverse and affordable â especially if youâve ever wanted to explore Japanâs hidden gems beyond the major tourist routes.

ð¥Eligible Countries
United States, Canada, Mexico, Thailand, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam, Philippines, Indonesia, India, China, Taiwan
