**Main Message:**

The video is contrasting the size (specifically, the number of gates) of two different airports: Soekarno-Hatta International Airport's Terminal 3 (mentioned as having only 30 gates) and a large international airport in Shanghai (mentioned as having approximately 500 gates). The initial text suggests that even a small 30-gate terminal can be tiring, implying humorous disbelief or exhaustion at the prospect of navigating the much larger 500-gate terminal in Shanghai. The main message is highlighting the vast difference in scale and size between the two international airport terminals.
