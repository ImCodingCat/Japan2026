**2. Audio/Speech**
The speaker narrates a personal experience traveling with AirAsia from Medan. They were threatened with having their cabin suitcase discarded or having to pay IDR 700,000 because AirAsia has become extremely strict with carry-on luggage dimensions. The problem was not the weight (7kg), but the height of the suitcase. Specifically, the regulation requires measurement to include the wheels, and the wheels on the speaker's ordinary, commercially purchased suitcase made it 1-2 cm too tall for the specific airline requirements (even an excess of 0.5 cm is not allowed). The speaker advises viewers to check and adhere to the regulations carefully, especially mentioning that airports in Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok are even stricter than Medan, with all dimensions and weight strictly measured.

**3. Main message**
The video aims to warn travelers flying with AirAsia about the airline's extremely strict enforcement of carry-on luggage size regulations, particularly the requirement to include the dimensions of the wheels in the overall height. It advises preparing carefully according to the exact measurements to avoid having to discard luggage or pay high fees.
