So if you’re ever in Japan and you don’t know where to eat lunch, I have a crazy travel hack for you. Walk around a busy street until you find a group of men wearing button-downs and name tags. They probably work in the area. They know all the best restaurants and they’re on their lunch break about to head to the best one they know. So just follow them. The other day, I followed this group of guys and they took me to this literal hole in the wall all you can eat Japanese fried chicken place for $8 and it was so good.
