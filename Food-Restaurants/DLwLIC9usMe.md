A waiter/waitress is heard saying that the food has arrived in Japanese. They mention that it is the regular size. ("お待たせいたしました。" and "並もどレギュラーサイズです。")

**Overall message:**
This video appears to be a promotional or food review segment showcasing regular-sized dishes of Unadon (grilled eel over rice), possibly with tamagoyaki (Japanese omelet). It focuses on the presentation and service of this specific dish at a restaurant, and the concluding screen introduces the creator, "Ah Le," who focuses on content related to food, drink, and entertainment.
