**Text Content:**
"POV: you can't read Japanese menus"
"Osumeme wa arimasuka?" - (Any recommendations?)
"何名様ですか" (Nanmei-sama desu ka) - How many people?
"Arigato" (ありがとう) - Thank you
"Osumeme wa nan desu ka?" - What is the recommendation?
"Osusumu wa oshe te ke renai de su" - Literally, "The recommendation, you will not [teach/tell] me." (Translation indicates seeking recommendations again)
"What's your like Ummm"
"Osusume"
"O musume wa...?" (お娘 は…?) - (Your daughter?)
"Osusume wa arimasu ka?" - (Do you have recommendations?)

**Audio/Speech Summary:**
The speaker repeatedly uses or attempts to use the Japanese word for "recommendation" ("Osusume" or "Osusume wa arimasuka?") when interacting in what appears to be a sequence of Japanese restaurant settings. In some instances where they try to use the polite form for "recommendation" ("Osusume wa arimasuka?"), the staff (played by the same person) responds with unrelated phrases like "How many people?" or "Thank you," or simply an echoing misunderstanding, sometimes even mistaking "Osusume" (recommendation) for "O musume" (daughter).

**Overall Message:**
The video humorously illustrates the difficulty and potential for awkward misunderstandings when a non-Japanese speaker is in a Japanese restaurant setting and relies heavily on one key phrase ("recommendation" - *Osusume*) because they cannot read the menu, often leading to communication breakdown. It highlights the problem of linguistic limitations in a foreign setting.
