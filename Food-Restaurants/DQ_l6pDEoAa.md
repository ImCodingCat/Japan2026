Here is an analysis of the video's core content:

**1. Text Content:**
* **On-screen text (transcribed and summarized):**
    * "Orang-orang yang bilang cara menghemat di Jepang adalah dengan makan di konbini pasti belum tahu trik yang satu ini." (People who say the way to save money in Japan is by eating at *konbini* [convenience stores] surely don't know this trick.)
    * "pergi ke Supermarket" (go to the supermarket)
    * "lewat dari jam 7.00 malam," (past 7:00 p.m.,)
    * "soalnya ada diskon buat makanan siap santap mereka." (because there's a discount on their ready-to-eat food.)
    * "bento bento ini contohnya diskon 30%" (these bento boxes, for example, are 30% off)
    * "jadi kalau tadinya 1000 yen dia jadi 700 yen." (so if it was originally 1000 yen, it becomes 700 yen.)
    * "Ini salah satu strategi gue pas ke Jepang 17 hari" (This is one of my strategies when I went to Japan for 17 days)
    * "soalnya gak mungkin gue tiap hari makan mewah. Pulang-pulang nanti gue makannya nasi pakai garam." (because there's no way I can eat fancy every day. I'll end up eating rice with salt when I get home.)
    * "diskon supermarket itu dimulai dan ditandai dengan adanya staf mereka yang muter-muter ngecekin semua makanan dengan alat dan ditempelin stiker kayak si bapak yang barusan." (Supermarket discounts start and are marked by staff moving around checking all the food with a tool and sticking stickers on them, like the man who just did.)
    * "Terus diskonnya itu diskon progresif," (Furthermore, the discount is progressive,)
    * "jadi kalau supermarketnya tutup jam 10.00 malam, diskonnya akan makin gede kalau kalian datangnya jam 9.00," (so if the supermarket closes at 10:00 p.m., the discount will be bigger if you come at 9:00 p.m.,)
    * "terus stikernya ditempel-tempel terus gitu ditambambahin diskonnya." (and the stickers are continuously applied to increase the discount.)
    * "tapi perlu dicatat bahwa makanan ini semuanya dibuat fresh," (but it should be noted that all this food is made fresh,)
    * "jadi kualitasnya enggak kayak makanan frozen food di supermarket kita ya, jauh banget bedanya." (so the quality is not like the frozen food in our supermarkets, the difference is huge.)
    * "dia beli langsung dua paket. Satu buat makan malam, satu yang lagi gue simpan buat sarapan besok." (I immediately bought two packages. One for dinner, the other I saved for tomorrow's breakfast.)
    * "biar gue enggak usah nyari tempat makan sarapan gitu loh, pagi-pagi kan ribet ya." (so I don't have to look for a place to eat breakfast, it's a hassle early in the morning.)
    * "Nah, ini malam gue makan sushi. Lihat deh warnanya masih cantik-cantik bahkan mengkilat kan itu ikannya, meski udah malam, dia itu tetap fresh karena ditaruh di suhu yang tepat." (Now, this is me eating sushi at night. Look, the colors are still beautiful and even shiny, right? The fish, even though it's late, is still fresh because it's stored at the right temperature.)
    * "Satu paket sisanya gue panasin besokannya. Kebetulan gue tuh ada microwave dan kulkas di hotel gua, jadi masih aman banget. Ini gue bawa ke taman di Ueno." (I heated up the remaining packet the next day. Coincidentally, I had a microwave and fridge in my hotel, so it was safe. I brought this to Ueno park.)
    * "Rasanya enak kok, kayak makanan rumahan." (It tastes good, like homemade food.)
    * "dan dia tuh kan biasanya dibikin dalam porsi yang banyak terus dipisahin kan per kotak gitu satu-satu. Jadi pilihan makanannya tuh ada banyak juga, bervariasi dan enggak bikin bosan." (And they are usually made in large portions, then separated into individual boxes. So the food choices are wide, varied, and not boring.)
    * "Tapi ingat ya, enggak semua makanan di supermarketnya akan didiskon, jadi harus pintar-pintar ngecek dan milih." (But remember, not all food in the supermarket will be discounted, so you have to be smart about checking and choosing.)
    * "Cek terus deh supermarket dekat kalian." (Keep checking the supermarket near you.)

**2. Audio/Speech:**
The narration provides a detailed explanation of a budget traveling hack in Japan. The speaker mentions that instead of relying on convenience stores (*konbini*), a better saving strategy is to shop at supermarkets late in the evening (after 7:00 PM). At this time, ready-to-eat meals (like bento boxes and sushi) receive progressive discounts (e.g., 30% off), dropping a 1000 yen item to 700 yen. The discounts are progressive and increase closer to closing time (like 9:00 PM before a 10:00 PM closing), marked by staff applying stickers. The speaker emphasizes that this food is still fresh and high quality, unlike typical frozen supermarket food. The speaker shares their personal strategy of buying two discounted meals—one for dinner and one to store in their hotel fridge/microwave for breakfast—to save money and time. They conclude by noting that while the options are fresh and varied, travelers must be smart about checking and selecting the discounted items.

**3. Main Message:**
The video communicates a highly effective money-saving tip for travelers or residents in Japan: purchase pre-made bento boxes, sushi, and other ready-to-eat foods from local supermarkets late in the evening (typically after 7:00 PM). These items are heavily discounted (up to 30% or more, progressively increasing closer to closing) to avoid waste, providing a fresh, high-quality, and cost-effective alternative to eating out or relying on full-price convenience store food.
