# The BIGGEST egg & steak sandos in all of Japan ð³ð¥©ð¥ª 

Can be found at @dekasan_osaka in Osaka. They serve these fluffy egg sandos with whipped egg whites, egg salad, and an egg yolk drizzle for which people will line up. Theyâre basically an egg soufflÃ© and theyâre @yumiami_ approved ð¥ 

In my opinion, the real star of the show is the Harami steak sando, made with 400gr of perfectly cooked tender skirt steak garnished with pink peppercorns. Itâs the most expensive item on the menu at 2400Â¥ ~ $17 USD, but itâs so worth it! Itâs a massive portion. 

I recommend going on a weekday to avoid crowds and getting there early around 11am :) itâs a very small shop.

"GIANT EGG & STEAK SANDOS IN OSAKA"

**Audio/Speech Summary:**
The narrator introduces the sandwiches as potentially the biggest "sandos" (sandwiches) in Japan, found in Osaka. They specifically highlight the massive egg sandwich, which is made with three types of egg: fluffy egg whites, egg salad with mayo, and finished with an umami egg yolk drizzle, which is then broiled.

Next, they focus on the "star of the show," which is the 400-gram tender beef steak sandwich. The chef is shown preparing and wrapping the huge sandwich. Once cut in half, it reveals perfectly cooked beef, garnished with pink peppercorns to provide a floral taste that balances out the richness of the beef.

The narrator and a friend taste the sandwiches. The friend declares the egg sando the best egg sandwich she has ever had.

**Overall Message:**
The video is a food review and showcase of unusually large, gourmet egg and steak sandwiches ("sandos") found in Osaka, Japan (specifically highlighting their quality, ingredients, and impressive size).
