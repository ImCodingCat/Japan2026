**Text Content**
* **Title:** 5 dishes you have to try in Japan / ٥ أكلات لازم تجربهم في اليابان (5 dishes you must try in Japan)
* **General commentary:** This is hands down the best Japanese city for street food. If Japan had a kitchen, it would be in Osaka and here are the must try items when you visit.
* **Dish 1:** 1- Takoyaki, crispy outside, molten octopus goodness inside is messy, hot and absolutely perfect.
* **Dish 2:** 2- Okonomiyaki. Osaka's answer to the savory pancake. Cabbage, meat, sauces, it's a full meal in a sizzle.
* **Dish 3:** 3- Kushikatsu, deep fried everything on a stick. Japan means premium beef. Dip once, don't double dip, respect the sauce.
* **Dish 4:** 4- Fresh snow crab, charred to perfection. Sweet, smoky, and totally addictive.
* **Dish 5:** 5- Melon pan ice cream, warm bun, cold ice cream, game over for me.
* **Closing:** Restaurant names below. Osaka does not play when it comes to food so follow me for more videos like this.
