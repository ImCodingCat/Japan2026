*   **Activity 1:** Sagano Romantic Train — Described as a visually refreshing experience featuring the scenery of the Hozugawa River.
*   **Activity 2:** Hozugawa River Cruise — An immersive river experience, contrasting with just viewing the river from above; likened to white-water rafting (arung jeram).
*   **Activity 3:** Arabica Arashiyama — A coffee shop with what the speaker considers the "best view in the world" for an Arabica location.
*   **Food 4:** Hikiniku To Come — Described as minced meat (hamburger steak) that tastes "really good." Mentions that it will open in Jakarta next year.
*   **Food 5:** Kyoto Engine Ramen — Praises the taste of the broth and the pork chashu, calling it one of the best.
*   **Food 6:** Amam Dacotan (Bakery) — Claimed to be the "best bakery in all of Japan." Notes that it is only open for two hours for walk-ins, suggesting high demand, and advises people to buy a lot to avoid regret.
*   **Food 7 & 8:** Mochimochi Kyoto and Gokago Kyoto (Matcha) — Both are praised as viral and incredibly delicious.
*   **Product Endorsement (JavaMiFi):** The speaker mentions that before going to Japan, their essential ritual is to bring JavaMiFi (a global WiFi device, claimed to be No. 1 in Indonesia). Highlights include: true unlimited data, 100% guarantee of connectivity, easy pick-up at airports (Terminal 3 Soekarno-Hatta and other locations), and the ability to share with up to 5 devices.

The video serves as a compelling travelogue and review, promoting the most memorable and highly recommended attractions, eateries, and food items in Kyoto, Japan. It functions as a listicle of "must-try" things, ranging from scenic train rides and river cruises to popular ramen, high-quality bakeries, and viral matcha drinks.
