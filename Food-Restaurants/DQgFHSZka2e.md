**2. Audio/Speech Summary** (Spoken message in Indonesian):

The speaker introduces the topic of trying what is claimed to be the best ramen in Kyoto, Japan, a place which won a Trip Advisor award. The ramen is made by Chef Tatsuya, a former head chef at a fine dining restaurant in Australia, who now runs a Hokkaido-style ramen shop called Kyoto Engine Ramen. The restaurant is very crowded, and diners can watch the cooking process in the open kitchen. The speaker emphasizes that nearly 100% of the ingredients are fresh, including vegetables and meat sourced from local farms.

The speaker tries "The Kyoto Zesty Ramen" (which costs ¥1,900 / RP204,000). They describe the ramen's base as chicken broth mixed with a mountain of scallions and a special miso sauce from Sapporo, calling the resulting taste delicious. The broth is described as rich, thick, spicy, fragrant, and not overwhelming. The pork chashu is savory and melts in the mouth. They also note that the noodles are eggless, giving them a unique texture. The speaker highly recommends trying Kyoto Engine Ramen if visiting Kyoto.

Finally, the speaker initiates a giveaway, asking new followers to comment "RAMEN KYOTO" with 0 likes and 0 replies for a chance to win a new iPhone.
