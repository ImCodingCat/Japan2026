# My favourite sushi places in Osaka:

Starting with Fukuyoshi at No. 3: Come early for no crowds, no noise, just you and the chef quietly shaping perfect nigiri right in front of you. We ordered the 10-piece set: sea bream, chutoro, scallop, anago, glossy ikura on salmon. Incredible value, peaceful atmosphere. A hidden gem.

At No. 2: Gokai is the total opposite: lively, busy, pure Osaka energy. Technically âstanding sushi,â but our branch had seats. The sushi was overflowing. Their uni and ikura gunkan literally spilling off the plate. Thick toro maki, buttery amberjack, big portions, walk-in friendly, open all day. Amazing.

And finally, Kaminari is No. 1. Packed counter, friendly owners, insanely fast service. The portions are unreal, with thick salmon nigiri, otoro slabs, glazed unagi the size of your hand, and fat futomaki rolls. Loud, generous, and over the top in the best way. âOsakaâs No.1 Sushi Barâ feels 100% earned.
