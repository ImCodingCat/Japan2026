A day trip to Kyoto from Osaka
ft Halal food + places to go to

Dinner: Honolu Grande Kyoto
The ramen here (to me) is tastier than their outlet in Osaka so yes you need to dine in here when in Kyoto!

Back to Osaka by train again
Wish we had more time to explore other beautiful parts of Kyoto. Will return, iA 💖

A 50 min train ride from Osaka to Kyoto via the Kyoto Hankyu Line (approx 800 yen per person!) 🚂

We got around Kyoto by bus using our ICOCA/SUICA card.
You may pay by cash too (only 1000 yen & below accepted) 💵

First stop in Kyoto: Lunch at Matahari Padang. Affordable & yummy Indonesian food!

A relaxing stroll by Kamo River 💙
There were many locals just chilling by the river, enjoying the amazing weather & peaceful scenery ☁️

Next stop in Kyoto: Kurasu!
Kurasu is a brand founded in Kyoto so we just had to try it here! 📍 Kurasu, Ebisugawa

A short stop at Kyoto Gyoen Garden to enjoy the start of autumn 🍂 The Kyoto Imperial Palace is here too 🏯

The first Arabica Store in the world: Arabica at Higashiyama ☕✨
Try the Kyoto Latte!! 100 🫶

A Matcha cafe we found by chance very near to Arabica Higashiyama: Seivi 🍵 Please try the Matcha Latte because it's so good! TRUST!!
Have a matcha day.
