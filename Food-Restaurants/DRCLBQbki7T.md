**2. Audio/Speech:**

The narrator advises caution when buying single skewers of Wagyu off the street in Japan because they can be expensive (2,000 to 5,000 Yen per stick).

Instead, the narrator recommends two "All You Can Eat" (AYCE) Wagyu restaurants as an alternative for better value:

*   **Restaurant 1 (Rikimaru Shinsaibashi - Osaka):**
    *   Located on the 4th floor of a building.
    *   Offers AYCE Wagyu. The most expensive package is around 5,000-something Yen (referring to the Wagyu Course at 5,280 Yen).
    *   The restaurant is simple but very crowded.
    *   The most complete package includes Wagyu, scallop (hotate), shrimp, and especially delicious beef tongue (lidah sapi). The tongue is described as crispy and not tough.
    *   Value proposition: Around 500,000 Indonesian Rupiah (based on the approximate translation of 5,000 Yen) for AYCE with complete side dishes.
*   **Restaurant 2 (BeBu-Ya - Tokyo):**
    *   Recommended if you are in Tokyo.
    *   Described as a more "proper" (nicer/cleaner/more comfortable) location.
    *   Prices are slightly higher; the most complete package is 6,500 Yen (Premium Course).
    *   Offers a wider variety of meat options.
    *   Note: This location does not offer seafood but has many side dishes, including kimchi.
    *   The narrator emphasizes the high quality of the meat, especially the marbling/fat content.
