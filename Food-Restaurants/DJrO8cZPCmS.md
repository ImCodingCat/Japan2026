# The skewer is mid but Nikuya Yokocho in is NOT! All you can eat Kobe Beef and Wagyu and drinks for the price for 2-3 skewers. Plus itâs vibes and itâs in the centre of Shibuya right beside Tasuichi ð. 

The quality of the meats are fantastic and itâs deli style after the first round. So spam the Kobe beef for 90 minutes and drinks too!  The Kobe course starts around 15000 yen! #kobebeef #wagyu #japan #pr

**Audio/Speech:**
The speaker advises people to stop wasting their money on expensive ($50) Wagyu skewers in Tsukiji. Instead, they suggest going to Nikuya Yokocho in Shibuya, where for around $100, you can get an all-you-can-eat Kobe beef and all-you-can-drink package. They emphasize the quality and value, mentioning that the Kobe beef was "buttery" and they ate the same slice in the all-you-can-eat format six times. They state the price of two skewers in Tsukiji gets you an entire feast at Nikuya Yokocho.

**Overall message:**
The video's core message is to advise tourists or residents in Japan on how to get better value for high-quality beef (Kobe/Wagyu). It suggests skipping the individually priced, expensive Wagyu skewers found in places like Tsukiji and opting instead for the all-you-can-eat and all-you-can-drink deal at Nikuya Yokocho in Shibuya for a more substantial meal at a comparable or better price.
