**Audio/Speech Summary (Narrated/Spoken in Indonesian with English/Japanese words):**
The speaker provides a guide on how to order at Ichiran Ramen, especially for first-timers who might find the customization overwhelming.
1.  **Explaining the Order Sheet:** The speaker demonstrates filling out the yellow order sheet ("Order Sheet: Circle your preference").
2.  **Specific Preferences:** They detail their personal choices: Strong broth (dashi), medium richness, 1 clove of garlic, skipping green onion because they don't like it, skipping pork (chashu), choosing 1/2 mild original spicy red sauce, and requesting extra firm noodles ("ekstra keras").
3.  **Ordering Process:** After filling the sheet, the next step is ordering the main meal via the automatic machine (vending machine/touchscreen), which offers an English option. The customer chooses whether they want a set or just the ramen.
4.  **Receipt:** After payment, a receipt (nota) is received, which shouldn't be lost.
5.  **Reviewing Order:** The speaker shows their final order sheet selections again.
6.  **Recommendation:** They suggest that the key to a great Ichiran meal is the texture of the noodles (firm or extra firm).
7.  **Conclusion:** They show their completed ramen and a spicy version ordered by a friend, and state that the customized ramen was the most delicious Ichiran they had in Japan, largely because of the noodle texture. They encourage viewers to save and share the video for their Japan trip.

**Overall Message:**
The video is a practical guide on how to successfully customize and order ramen at Ichiran, focusing on specific preferences (like broth richness, garlic, spice level, and especially noodle texture) to maximize the taste experience, thereby helping first-time visitors or those unsure about the customization process.
