**Audio/Speech**
The speaker is a fitness enthusiast (Bang Chris) who is in Japan and wants to try an octopus-based street food snack (which appears to be Takoyaki) as a source of high protein. He notes that the octopus (gurita) has a relatively high protein content (around 25g per 100g). He shares a minor struggle trying to figure out how to order and pay using the ticket-vending machine, joking about needing to pretend to be competent ("pura-pura tegar"). After getting the Takoyaki (with mayo sauce and what he calls "cukurek"), he tries it and praises its taste, noting that it is still very hot.
