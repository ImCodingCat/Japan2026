- **On-screen question:** "Ask me a question is Ichiran no pork in Osaka is halal?"
- **Ichiran Website Text (screenshot):**
    *HOME > 100% Tonkotsu Free Ramen*
    *We have created ramen that does not use pork as an ingredient at all.*
    - *We do NOT use halal certified chicken or beef.*
    - *This is NOT halal ramen.*
    - *This ramen contains no pork, but is made in the same facilities that makes The Classic Tonkotsu Ramen (pork-bone broth).*

**2. Audio/Speech Summary:**
The speaker addresses a question about whether the "No Pork" Ichiran ramen in Osaka is Halal. He explains that Ichiran is a famous ramen chain and that they offer a special "No Pork" ramen made with chicken broth in Osaka. However, he reveals that based on Ichiran's official website, the ramen is **not Halal**. The official website explicitly states that they do not use Halal-certified chicken or beef, and while the ramen contains no pork, it is prepared in the same facilities that make their classic Tonkotsu (pork-bone broth) ramen. Therefore, even without pork in the meal, it is not Halal due to lack of certification and cross-contamination. He expresses sadness that many Muslims visit the location believing it is safe. He urges viewers to share the video with friends planning to visit Japan to ensure they eat Halal food.

**3. Main Message:**
The video's core message is a traveler warning: The Ichiran Ramen restaurant in Osaka that advertises a "No Pork" option (made with chicken broth) is **not Halal-certified**. Despite omitting pork ingredients, the food is cooked in facilities that handle pork-based products (cross-contamination), and the ingredients used (meat) are not sourced as Halal. Therefore, Muslims should be aware that the "No Pork" Ichiran ramen is not a Halal option.
