This Fukuoka udon shop serves a unique carbonara udon topped with freshly boiled noodles, eggs, and cheese.

Two rich, orange egg yolks sat beautifully on the noodles, and because the noodles are served hot, mixing them creates a creamy sauce that clings naturally to every strandâ¨

However, it lacked the punch of cheese and black pepper youâd expect from a traditional carbonara. Adding mentaiko (spicy cod roe) really helped enhance the flavor with its umami and mild spiciness.

You can skip the line by purchasing a Fast Pass (Â¥390), and reservations are also availableâdefinitely worth keeping in mind for your visit!
