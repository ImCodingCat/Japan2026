Apps for travelling to Japan (as someone who just got back)

- Suica Wallet: so much easier than a physical travel card...no more fumbling around with coins at the ticket counter whilst a line of people wait behind you iOS only though
- Google Translate: Can use for menus & conversations Make sure to have BOTH Japanese and English downloaded before going
- Google Maps: essential, accurate, works well for public transport (even tells you which train carriage to get onto for fastest transfer)
- Go/Taxi App: the best taxi app in Japan often cheaper than uber pretty easy to use interface can set up before you go!
- Ecbo Cloak: allows you to rent nearby storage excellent for bulky luggage can be essential during transit days
- Ramen Beast: find authentic local ramen (no chain restaurants, just the real deal)
