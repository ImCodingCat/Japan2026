- It's a airport in Osaka. Many foreign travelers use this airport. I'm going to show you three ways from this airport to Osaka city center. I'm going to Dotonbori area by Nankai Train. This is my recommendation.
- No. 1: Nankai Line
- Look for this orange sign!
- The Nankai Line is convenient as it has no transfer.
- It takes about 45 minutes from Kansai Airport Station to Namba Station, costing ¥930.
- There's also limited express option, which gets you into central Osaka even faster!
- No. 2: JR Line
- Look for this blue sign!
- Takes the JR Line to Tennoji Station where you'll transfer to get to Namba Station.
- This option takes about an hour and costs ¥1,080.
- No. 3: Limousine Bus
- The bus takes about an hour and costs ¥1,100, running every 30 minutes.
- Just head to the bus stop where you can purchase your ticket.
- The last bus departs around 8 PM, please be careful if you're arriving late at night.
