**Audio/Speech**:
The narrator introduces the video as a list of 7 essential apps for travelers visiting Japan.
1. **Google Maps** is necessary, but the narrator suggests using **Kuli Kuli** instead of Google Translate for better accuracy.
2. **Payke** is recommended for shopping, allowing users to scan barcodes and get product information in English.
3. For physical IC cards (like Suica) to check train/bus balances, the narrator suggests a balance check app (referencing the "Japan train card balance check" app).
4. For iPhone users, the physical IC card is optional, as they can activate a digital IC card (Suica) within **Apple Wallet** or download the **Welcome Suica App** for public transportation within cities.
5. While **Uber** works in Japan, the narrator also recommends **Go Taxis** to compare ride prices.
6. Mobile data is necessary for all these apps. The narrator personally prefers **Klook's Unlimited Data eSim**, which can be activated within the Klook app while booking other travel activities.
7. The narrator mentions that the 7-day eSim from Klook cost $19 for their week-long trip.

**Overall message**:
The video is a travel guide listing 7 essential apps (or related services) and a data solution needed for a successful and convenient trip to Japan. The recommended apps cover navigation (Google Maps), translation (Kuli Kuli), shopping information (Payke), public transport payment/balance checking (Japan train card balance check app, Apple Wallet/Suica, Welcome Suica App), and ride-hailing (Uber/Go Taxis), along with a recommendation for a travel eSim (Klook) for mobile data access.
