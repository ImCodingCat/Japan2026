- The user enters a first name ("MICHAEL") and a last name ("NATANAEL").
- They proceed to the next steps involving gender and date of birth entry (Male is selected).

- During payment, the user inserts 1000 Yen bills one by one, counting them up to 5000 Yen.
- An automated female voice from the machine speaks occasionally in Japanese, likely confirming selections or giving instructions (e.g., "A receipt is printed," and reminders to take dispensed items/change).
- At the end, the user concludes that the final cost of the card is ¥4500 (since ¥500 is a deposit).
