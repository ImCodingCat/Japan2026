**Audio/Speech:**

The audio reinforces the text content, discussing the previous dependency on buying and topping up specific Japanese e-money cards (like Suica/Pasmo/Icoca) using cash at vending machines. It then announces that starting in 2025, foreign bank cards from Indonesia (specifically those with Visa or JCB logos) can be used directly for "Tap to Pay" transit across Japan.

**Overall Message:**

The core message is a traveler tip regarding a significant update in Japan's public transportation payment system. Starting in 2025, visitors to Japan will no longer need to purchase and load local e-money IC cards (like Suica) as they will be able to use their existing international bank cards (specifically those from Indonesia with Visa/JCB via the "Tap to Pay" system) directly at transit gates, simplifying travel and eliminating the need for cash top-ups.
