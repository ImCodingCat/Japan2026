**Throughout the video, captions highlight the main points:**

*   **Initial text:** 10 Hal Penting Sebelum Lo Ke Jepang (10 Important Things Before You Go to Japan)
*   **Tips #1 Transport Praktis (Practical Transport):** You don't need a JR Pass if you're only touring Tokyo and Osaka. Buy an IC Card (Suica/Penguin card). Top it up and you can use almost all transportation.
*   **Tips #2 Cash is King:** Not all places accept cards, especially small restaurants in the suburbs. Exchange money in Jakarta/your home country, because relying only on ATMs is unreliable.
*   **Tips #3 Aplikasi Sakti! (Magic Apps!):** Google Maps and Weather are accurate. Make sure to check before adventuring each day. (Includes an image showing "How To Read Google Maps Train Ride" with instructions).
*   **Tips #4 Jangan Abis Waktu Tenaga Di Jalan (Don't Waste Time and Energy on the Road):** Traveling between cities is exhausting. Recommended minimum 2-3 days per city. Don't plan too many cities for a 7-day itinerary, or you won't enjoy anything, only rushing for photos.
*   **Tips #5 What To Bring?!:** Clothes are not necessary to bring many, but you must have comfortable shoes. If you don't have them, be ready to shop, because shoes here can be 30% cheaper than in Indonesia. (Also includes text: "Traveler Indonesia 1 Flight ON SEMUA dong" - *Indonesian travelers wear comfortable shoes on the plane/everywhere*).
*   **Tips #6 Mind Your Manners!:** Don't disturb Japanese people. They are polite, not friendly. Follow their rules. Ask if you don't understand, don't pretend to know.
*   **Tips #7 Do Your Research Pls!:** Make sure to do your research. There are many tourist traps and things people say are viral aren't really like that. Mostly, the food standard is good, don't waste time queuing for viral food.
*   **Tips #8 Alternatif Capsule Hotel:** Capsule hotels are cheap, but not for everyone. If you are a light sleeper or carry many things, find a small business hotel instead. The price difference is small, but it's much better.
*   **Tips #9 Bus Malam = Double Hemat! (Night Bus = Double Savings!):** For those who want to save money, you can try riding a night bus (e.g., from Tokyo to Osaka or Kyoto). You can save a lot, more than 50%. But, for families, this is not suitable.
*   **Tips #10 Read Caption!:** The last point is in the caption, so make sure you read it.

## Audio/Speech Summary
The speaker introduces himself as Ray, offering 10 practical tips for traveling to Japan.

1.  **Transport:** Skip the expensive JR Pass if only visiting Tokyo and Osaka. Just use an IC card (like Suica) and consistently top it up for all transportation needs.
2.  **Cash:** Cash is essential. Many places, especially smaller restaurants outside the main areas, don't accept cards. Exchange money before you leave, as relying on Japanese ATMs isn't always reliable.
3.  **Apps:** Google Maps and weather apps are accurate in Japan. Always check them before starting your day's journey.
4.  **Itinerary Planning:** Changing cities is tiring. Stay at least 2-3 days in one city. Don't overload a short itinerary (like 7 days) with too many cities, or you'll be too exhausted to enjoy anything.
5.  **What to Pack:** You don't need many clothes, but you must bring comfortable shoes because you'll walk a lot. If you don't have comfortable shoes, you might end up shopping for shoes there, which can be 30% cheaper than in Indonesia.
6.  **Manners:** Be mindful of Japanese manners. Japanese people are often polite, but not necessarily friendly. Follow their rules. If you don't understand something, ask; don't just assume.
7.  **Research:** Do thorough research. Avoid tourist traps and viral foods that might not be worth the hype. Most food in Japan is already of good standard, so don't waste time waiting in long lines for viral places.
8.  **Accommodation:** Capsule hotels are cheap but not for everyone (especially light sleepers or those with a lot of luggage). Consider small business hotels; they are slightly more expensive but much better.
9.  **Night Bus:** For significant savings, try taking a night bus between major cities (like Tokyo up to Osaka/Kyoto) to save over 50% compared to trains. However, this is not suitable for families.
10. **Final Tip:** The last tip is located in the video's written caption (prompting viewers to read the full caption).
