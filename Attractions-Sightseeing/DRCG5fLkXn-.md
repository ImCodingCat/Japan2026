**2. Audio/Speech:**
The speaker, who identifies as Japanese, shares her preferences and tips regarding authentic Japanese experiences, contrasting them with popular tourist options:
*   She prefers the grocery store "My Basket" over convenience stores (like FamilyMart) because it's cheaper (using bottled water prices as an example: 68 yen vs. 108 yen).
*   She prefers Meiji Jingu shrine over Asakusa (Sensoji Temple) because Asakusa is crowded, while Meiji Jingu is spacious, surrounded by nature, and feels sacred. She notes that Meiji Jingu is the most popular for New Year visits.
*   She explains that while she usually pays cashless, truly local Japanese spots (like the tempura shop shown) often only accept cash. She highly recommends these cash-only, non-touristy places for an authentic experience, but warns that staff might not speak English.
*   She offers a free service (until the end of the year) to guide people to authentic local restaurants, teach easy Japanese phrases, and share her favorite spots. Interested viewers should follow and DM her.

**3. Main Message:**
The video communicates that visitors can find more authentic, less touristy, and sometimes cheaper experiences in Japan by avoiding major tourist traps and popular spots (like convenience stores and Asakusa). It suggests alternatives like My Basket supermarket and Meiji Jingu shrine, and encourages seeking out small, cash-only local establishments for a "truly Japanese" experience. The speaker then offers a free personal guidance and travel advice service to help viewers access these authentic local spots.
