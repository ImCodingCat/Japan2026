Transportation
Getting around Kyoto is relatively easy — most spots are connected by buses or the subway, and using an IC card like Suica or Icoca makes everything effortless (but be prepared to walk a lot too).
For temples and shrines, the buses go pretty much everywhere while the JR and metro lines are great for covering longer distances.
