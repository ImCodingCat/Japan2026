# The BEST tip to beat the crowds in Japan? ð¸ Wake up before the world does. ð

When I visited during cherry blossom season, every city was packed â honestly the most crowded place Iâve ever traveled! But Japan is so worth it. ð¯ðµ Between the culture, friendly locals, incredible food (sashimi heaven ð), and stunning temples, itâs one of my favorite countries in the world.

If youâre planning your trip, hereâs how to actually enjoy Japan without the chaos:
ð Wake up early (jet lag will help!)
ðï¸ Reserve attractions the moment slots open
ð´ Book restaurants months in advance

That way, youâll have those dreamy spots all to yourself â and get the perfect shot ð¸.

Would you wake up for sunrise to skip the crowds? ð¸
