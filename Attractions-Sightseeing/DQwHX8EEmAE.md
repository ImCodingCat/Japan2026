The narration gives a step-by-step direction on how to find the sauna: starting from Dotonbori, turning right, going straight past a Lawson store (where you can buy snacks and drinks), crossing the street, entering a building, taking the lift to the 9th floor, and going up a small set of stairs. The speaker then introduces the location as Dotonbori Sauna, describing it as a hidden private sauna with a view of Dotonbori. The key features mentioned are that you get an entire floor to yourself, you can enjoy an authentic Finnish barrel sauna with self-löyly (pouring water on hot stones), and cool down in a Japanese cypress cold bath. Convenience amenities include free coffee, and everything needed (towels, shower) is provided, so guests only need to bring a swimsuit.
