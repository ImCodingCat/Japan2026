For those of you like me, whose vacation time is limited, yet you would like to make the most of your time in Japan, you will need 3 days in Kyoto.Â 

I walked a lot, around 20k steps per day, took a bus and uber and rented a bike, which I highlyÂ recommend as it is the best way to get around.

In Ideal world I would stay longer, as there are so many more amazing things to do, but
