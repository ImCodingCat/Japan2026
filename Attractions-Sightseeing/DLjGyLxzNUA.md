# We cycled 100km on one of the most scenic cycling trails in the Southern region of Japan. 

this is the shinanami kaido cycling route

I think I would go as far as to say it altered my brain chemistry thats how PEAK this experience was. Like I can't put into words how much I enjoyed this experience, especially amongst company with 6 other incredible people. When you are cycling in a peloton with your friends alongside the ocean, there is just nothing that beats that. 

We cycled more than 100km across one day, and being a novice cyclists, this wasn't an easy feat, but I think this is completely approachable to people who are even slightly physically fit. We actually cycled the wrong way and ended up cycling around a island twice, adding an extra 30km ontop of the normal 70km trail, but I think that made it better. The chase to catchup to that one friend who actually went the right way was so adrenaline inducing. The highs and lows of this trail just made it so damn memorable, far more than sightseeing some shrine or visiting some tourist attraction. 

@iocmcb clutched with with some amazing footage of our largest cycling trail - I completely forgot to bring my action camera ð­

The first person footage is NOT of the same trail - it was recorded in other regions in Japan. If you want details on that let me know.

Here's an analysis of the video's content:

**1. Text content:**

*   "Why would anyone go cycling in Japan?"
*   "anthonyg.xdr" (Likely a username or watermark at the end)

**2. Audio/Speech:**

The audio consists of music with lyrics. The lyrics (in the segments where they are clear) are:

*   "How do we go back to being friends when we just shared a bed?"
*   (Repeated later) "How do we go back to being friends when we just shared a bed?"
*   "How do we go back? And let me pretend I'm someone you never met."
*   (Repeated later) "How do we go back? And let me pretend I'm someone you never met."

**3. Main message:**

The core content of the video is twofold:

*   **Promotional/Experiential:** It showcases the experience and varied scenery of cycling (presumably shared/rental cycling given the yellow bikes and initial question) in Japan, highlighting cityscapes, rural roads, forests, and especially the scenic bridges and coastlines (like along the Shimanami Kaido or similar cycling routes).
*   **Narrative/Emotional (Implied by lyrics):** The background music introduces a dramatic or reflective emotional narrative revolving around a strained relationship and the difficulty of returning to a previous state ("just friends") after an intimate connection.

In essence, the video juxtaposes the active, scenic, and practical experience of cycling in Japan with a strong, melodramatic lyrical theme of romantic regret and complexity.
