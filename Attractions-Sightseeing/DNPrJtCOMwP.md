# Best tip to avoid the crowds in Japan â¬ï¸

is to wake up early & get to popular tourist places before sunrise! ð

I went to Japan during cherry blossom season last year, and every city I went to was incredibly crowded! Definitely the most crowded place Iâve traveled to ð¸

But it is so worth it! Japan is one of the most incredible places to visit and is one of my favorite countries Iâve ever been to. The culture, friendly locals, delicious food (and amazing sashimi), stunning attractions, and historic temples are just some of the many reasons to visit Japan ð¯ðµ 

And if youâre going to Japan and want to avoid the crowdsâ¦
ð Wake up early 
ðï¸ Reserve attractions in advance (check to see when their reservation slots open!)
ð´ Make lunch/dinner reservations early (like months in advance!)

Also if youâre jet lagged, it will be easier to wake up early and have the famous tourist attractions all to yourself! (Plus youâll get your perfect shot ð¸)
â¨Are you team sunrise? ð

**Overall Message:**
The video communicates the importance of visiting popular tourist attractions—specifically Fushimi Inari Taisha, Higashiyama Ward, and Arashiyama Bamboo Forest—early in the morning (6 AM to 7 AM) to avoid large crowds. By contrasting the visuals at these early times with those taken just one or two hours later, the video emphasizes that going early allows for a less crowded, more peaceful experience.
