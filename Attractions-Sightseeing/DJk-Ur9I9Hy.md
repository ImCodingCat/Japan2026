**2. Audio/Speech:**
The people interviewed recommend the following places:

- **Daimonji-yama:** Recommended for the Obon festival when a large bonfire shaped like the character "Dai" (大) is lit on the mountain (Gozan Okuribi).
- **Yasaka Shrine and Kamo River:** Suggested as relaxing spots that are less crowded.
- **Gojo-rakuen:** Mentioned as a place with traditional crafts, cafes, and public baths often frequented by locals.
- **Arashiyama:** Recommended to visit early in the morning because it gets extremely crowded during the day (sometimes visitors can't even get a taxi).
- **Enryakuji on Mount Hiei:** Described as a sacred place with an old temple.
- **Sanjusangendo:** Recommended specifically for the thousand Kannon statues, where each face is different, and the interviewee visits to find the statues that resemble her deceased parents.

**3. Main message:**
The video's core message is to provide recommendations for less touristy or locally appreciated places in Kyoto, offering insights into why locals recommend these spots (e.g., historical importance, peaceful atmosphere, local activities, or unique features like the statues at Sanjusangendo). The video concludes with a promotional advertisement for a "TOKYO COMPLETE GUIDE."
