**2. Audio/Speech Summary**
The speaker begins by describing the Umeda Sky Building in Osaka, noting that it looks ordinary but is actually one of the 20 most iconic buildings globally, comparable to the Eiffel Tower. She mentions the building's height (139m) and location in Osaka. She then talks about the Santa Maria Cruise in Osaka Bay, a large, Columbus-style ship tour lasting 45 minutes, calling the experience fun and great for photos.

She then transitions to a travel tip, admitting that on her first trip to Osaka, she wasted money ("lost millions") by buying tickets for attractions separately. She explains that there is a single "Pass" (the Kansai Pass) that includes tickets for all the most famous attractions in Osaka, including airport transfers. This pass also gives discounts on experiences like the open-top city bus tour (which she also showed). She mentions the pass is valid for one week and can even be used to travel to Kyoto. She concludes by promoting the pass via Klook and offering a discount voucher code (**EVELYNPRICILIAKLOOK**).

**3. Main Message**
The video's main message is to recommend using the **"Have Fun in Kansai Pass"** (booked via Klook) when visiting Osaka and Kyoto. The speaker highlights that this pass saves money by bundling access to major attractions (like the Umeda Sky Building and Santa Maria Cruise) and essential services (like airport transfers), preventing travelers from making the mistake of buying tickets individually.
