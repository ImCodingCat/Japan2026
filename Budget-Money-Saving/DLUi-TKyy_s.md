**Audio/Speech Summary**

The speaker advises viewers against buying expensive bottled mineral water at convenience stores (like 7-Eleven) in Japan. They state it's a "big mistake" and explain how to get clean drinking water for free.

The process involves first purchasing a reusable 4-liter bottle (around 60,000 IDR) or a 2-liter bottle (around 50,000 IDR) at a supermarket (they later point to a specific supermarket). Once you have the dedicated bottle, you can search for a specific water dispensing machine (usually at the supermarket, referred to as an "ISI," meaning 'fill' or 'refill').

The user demonstrates opening the bottle, placing the cap in a dedicated sanitizing slot, and then placing the bottle into the machine. The machine fills the bottle with clean, purified water (not tap water) automatically. The speaker emphasizes that this method is very sanitary and saves money, especially for people living or traveling in Japan long-term. They finish by encouraging viewers to look for the nearest supermarket with this machine and ask for more Japan travel tips in the comments.

**Overall Message**

The video's core message is to provide a money-saving and hygienic alternative to buying expensive bottled mineral water in Japanese convenience stores. It teaches viewers a specific method found in Japanese supermarkets: purchasing a designated refillable bottle one time, and then refilling it with purified drinking water for free at a specialized dispensing machine.
