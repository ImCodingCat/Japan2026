2. **Audio/Speech**:
- The speaker advises on which months to "avoid" when traveling to Japan and "when to come instead."
- December and the beginning of January are expensive due to the festive period. Instead, travelers should come in late January or February to experience snow at a fraction of the price.
- April is cherry blossom season, making it one of the most expensive months to travel. Instead, come in March to see the early spring blooms and cherry blossom-inspired items.
- June to August is hot, humid, and rainy. Instead, come in May for sunny weather without the crazy heat.
- September is typhoon season. Instead, come in October or November for the most well-balanced temperatures and sunny weather.
- A final reminder is given to use Skyscanner for finding the best hotel and flight deals for Japan trips. The video also claims to have "heaps of other Japan travel tips."

3. **Main message**:
The video offers seasonal travel advice for visiting Japan, specifically highlighting which months to avoid due to high costs, extreme weather, or peak tourist seasons (December/early January, April, June-September) and recommends the best alternate months (late January/February, March, May, October, November) for better value, pleasant weather, or specific seasonal experiences like early spring blooms. It encourages viewers to book travel through Skyscanner for deals.
