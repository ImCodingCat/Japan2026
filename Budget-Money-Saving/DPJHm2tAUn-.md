*   **On-screen text (Prices/Signage Summary):** The video displays a signage for "Coin Lockers" (harga dihitung per 24 jam, maksimal 3 hari) with prices for different sizes: S (500 yen), M (600 yen), L (800 yen). It also shows a sign for "Baggage Storage" (JR Official Storage) with operating hours (10:00 AM - 8:00 PM) and prices calculated by total dimensions: S (up to 100cm, ¥500), M (101-200cm, ¥1000), L (201cm and up, ¥2000).

**2. Audio/Speech:**
The speaker discusses a common challenge for first-time visitors to Japan (Tokyo/Osaka): storing luggage at the station.
*   **Locker system warning:** The standardized coin locker system in Japan has a "trick" (daily charging cycles) where miscalculating a day can lead to accumulated fees. Coin lockers charge per 24 hours and have a maximum limit of 3 days; luggage exceeding this time may be moved by staff.
*   **Long-term storage solution:** For storing luggage longer than 3 days (even weeks or months), the solution is using the JR Official Storage.
*   **Pricing:** The speaker provides the pricing details for both coin lockers and the official storage, recommending users screenshot the price board.
*   **Important Tip:** The receipt for the locker (Locker Usage Voucher) is very small and easily lost, so users should take a photo of it or keep it secure in their wallet.
*   **Conclusion:** When traveling to Japan, it's best to choose the cheap daily lockers or the official long-term storage to keep luggage safe without worrying about time limits.
