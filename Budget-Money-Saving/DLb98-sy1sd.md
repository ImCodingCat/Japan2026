**Audio/Speech Summary:**

The speaker warns viewers about eating out late at night in Japan because some restaurants (specifically mentioning a Tonkatsu place, Matsunoya) impose an extra charge called a "late-night fee." This fee applies to orders placed between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m., whether you eat in or take away (bento).

The speaker then provides a tip to avoid or mitigate this extra charge: use the restaurant's mobile application. The app often offers coupons with significant discounts. They demonstrate how these coupons, like a 200 yen discount, can make the meal cheaper than the regular everyday price, effectively offsetting the late-night fee. They also note that when ordering a set meal via the coupon, you might not be able to upgrade the rice portion (it stays regular rice).

Finally, they conclude by showing their takeout bag, stating the meal was cheap (only 600 yen), and reiterating the warning: if you are in Japan and eating late at night, be careful, check the menus, as prices can be considerably higher than regular menu prices due to the surcharge.

**Overall Message:**

The video's core message is a travel tip for tourists in Japan: Be aware that many quick-service or chain restaurants impose a *late-night fee* (extra charge) for orders placed between 10:00 PM and 5:00 AM. To save money and potentially offset this fee, travelers should utilize the restaurant's mobile application and coupons, which can offer significant discounts.
