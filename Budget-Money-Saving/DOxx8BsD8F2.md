**Audio/Speech Summary:**

The speaker introduces five tips on how they save up to 60% while traveling in Japan.

1.  **Avoid Peak Season:** Advise travelers to avoid expensive months like March, April, early May, November, and December, due to Sakura, Golden Week, Autumn colors, and year-end holidays, which significantly increase hotel prices (up to a difference of Rp 1 million per night compared to off-peak months like February).
2.  **Explore Small Towns:** Suggests exploring smaller cities outside major hubs like Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka, noting that accommodation in smaller towns like Kanazawa can be drastically cheaper (saving about Rp 2 million per night compared to Tokyo).
3.  **Eat at Cheap Restaurants:** Recommends eating at budget restaurant chains (Matsuya, Sukiya, Yoshinoya, Tendon Tenya, Saizeriya) as they are often cheaper than even convenience store foods, resulting in potential daily savings of Rp 300k.
4.  **Buy a City Pass Instead of a JR Pass:** Advises against buying the JR Pass and instead suggests purchasing city-specific passes (like the Tokyo Metro Pass) to save 50% on daily transportation costs.
5.  **Don't Ship Luggage:** Notes that shipping luggage between hotels (using services like Yamato Transport) is expensive (around Rp 500k per way for a 28-inch suitcase). The speaker prefers carrying her own luggage to save money, potentially saving Rp 1 million for a round-trip shipment, enough for a Tokyo Disneyland ticket.
